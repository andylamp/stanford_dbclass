In this question, you are to create a `DTD` for a small `XML` data set about world 
countries. This data is adapted from the Mondial 3.0 database as hosted by the 
University of Washington, and was originally compiled by the Georg-August 
University of Goettingen Institute for Informatics. Each country has a name, 
population, and area (in sq. km). Some countries also list languages 
(with percentages of the population that speaks each language) and/or 
cities (with names and populations). The `XML` data is here. 

Write a `DTD` for the `XML` data set. 

Important: Do not include `<!DOCTYPE countries [...]>` in your `DTD`. 
Your DTD should start with `<!ELEMENT countries (country*)>`.
